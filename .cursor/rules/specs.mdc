_The web application "Health-App"_

**Description**

- The following pages are to be implemented in this application:
  - Top page (login page) ・・・ URL path: /. See top-page-specs.mdc
  - My Page ・・・ URL path: /myPage. See my-page-specs.mdc
  - Authentication Failure Display ・・・ /authenticationError. See authenticate-failed-page-specs.mdc
  - Not Found ・・・ URL path: other than the above. See not-found-page-specs.mdc
- Use the data from the API of the following URL for the data of this application (values of graphs, dates of records, images of meals, etc.).
  - API endpoint: https://health_app_api.dev-arent.workers.dev
  - The schema of the API is described in OpenAPI format at the following URL. Please check here: https://health_app_api.dev-arent.workers.dev/openapi
- Use [React Router v7 - latest](https://reactrouter.com/start/data/installation) for routing.
- Use [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/installation) for data fetching
- Use TypeScript as the application development language.
- Use [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for styling
  - **Always use `rem` units instead of `px`** for all sizing values (fonts, spacing, dimensions, etc.)
  - Base font size is set to 62.5% (10px base), so **1rem = 10px**
  - Easy conversion: divide px by 10 (e.g., 24px = 2.4rem, 16px = 1.6rem, 48px = 4.8rem)
  - Use the `pxToRem()` utility function from `src/utils/pxToRem.ts` for conversions if needed
- Implement Linter and Formatter packages to enforce consistency in coding style.
  - Linter: ESLint
  - Formatter: Prettier
- Write test code so that coverage can be measured.
  - Testing framework: Vitest
  - Expect coverage percentage is 80% and above
  - Should have unit test for utils functions, custom hooks, components.
  - Should have integration tests for pages.

**Important**

- Make sure to follow README.md during development
- This App has an authentication (login) function. Please refer to the Functional-Requirements(has defined on Cursor rules) and OpenAPI schema for the specifications of the authentication function.
- This App is available in both PC and Mobile sizes. Ensure that your implementation is responsive. However, the layout of the responsive design is up to you. As long as you follow the points below, the responsive design itself will not affect your results.
  - Breakpoints:
    - min 415px
    - max 1024px
    - can have more breakpoints beyond 415px and 1024px if needed to improve UX and prevent UI issues.
  - Elements do not fall out of columns.
  - The width of the screen does not overflow (no horizontal scrolling or element clipping occurs).
  - Even on a Mobile-size screen, visibility of text and operability of the UI can be ensured as in a general web application.
- Use the following image data format:
  - svg for assets stored in project directory /assets
  - url if we map it from API responses
- The following fonts are used. All of them can be downloaded from Google Fonts.
  - Japanese → Noto Sans JP Regular(400) and Bold(700): https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP
  - Alphanumeric → Inter Regular(400) and Bold(700): https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter
