*Top Page (Login Page)*

**Functional-Requirements**
- Routing path should be「/」
- When accessed with authentication, the user should be redirected to My Page (/myPage).
- The form has only one field: a password field. When a user enters the password and submits the form, they should be redirected to My Page upon successful authentication.
- Each element of the footer must be a link, and has href="#" set.

**Design-Requirements**
- The area of the gradient background must be the height of the full screen.
- The input placeholder must be labeled 「パスワードを入力(Input password)」
- The password input field must use password masking (type="password") to hide each character as an asterisk (e.g., "password" displays as "********")
- Unnecessary zooming in should not occur when operating the input form on a smartphone.
- Even if you repeatedly press the login button, multiple transmissions will not occur until the authentication process is complete.
- Clickable elements should have a visible change when hovered (design is not specified).
- Consider the accessibility of each element.

**Abnormal-System-Handling**
- Error messages should be displayed when authentication fails due to password mismatch, etc.
- In case of validation errors such as not entering the password, a UI or error message will be displayed indicating that the authentication request cannot be sent.
- Any design is acceptable as long as the content can be judged in terms of abnormality handling.


**Supplements about API**
- When "password" is sent as password-string to the authentication API, an object containing an access token is returned.
- If any other string is sent, a 401 error is returned.
